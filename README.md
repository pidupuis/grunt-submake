# grunt-submake

> Run Make rules through Grunt tasks (by just specifying the Makefile path and the rules!)

## Description

If your project integrates subprojects using [GNU Make](http://www.gnu.org/software/make/), this plugin is made for you! With this plugin you will be able to run any Make rules from any Makefile inside any Grunt task.

Numerous use cases including:
* Build your Make-based subprojects during the build of your Grunt-based parent project,
* Run your subprojects' tests during the test process of your parent project,
* Combine `grunt-contrib-watch` with the power of Make to rebuild modified subprojects' parts without manual server reloading,
* Define easily a submake task for each Make-based subproject (no need to remember which rules to run for which subproject),
* Handle easily interoperability between Make and Grunt in every case (<b>no need for subprojects specifically</b>),
* Keep using command lines without shame (custom Grunt tasks are pretty cool but they could wait),
* Do a lot of other thing only you could imagine!

#### This plugin is compatible with <b>[CMake](http://www.cmake.org/)</b>!

This plugin was inspired by [grunt-subgrunt](https://github.com/tusbar/grunt-subgrunt), which rocks the world by the way.

## Getting Started
This plugin requires Grunt `~0.4.5`
This plugin aims to run GNU Make commands for subprojects based on this tool so be sure to have [GNU Make](http://www.gnu.org/software/make/) installed.

If you haven't used [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) guide, as it explains how to create a [Gruntfile](http://gruntjs.com/sample-gruntfile) as well as install and use Grunt plugins. Once you're familiar with that process, you may install this plugin with this command:

```shell
npm install grunt-submake --save-dev
```

Once the plugin has been installed, it may be enabled inside your Gruntfile with this line of JavaScript:

```js
grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-submake');
```

## The "submake" task

### Overview
In your project's Gruntfile, add a section named `submake` to the data object passed into `grunt.initConfig()`.

```js
grunt.initConfig({
  submake: {
    your_target: {
      options: {
        // Target-specific options
      },
      projects: {
        // Paths to subprojects' Makefile
      }
    },
  },
});
```

### Options

#### options.cmake
Type: `Array`

Determines if you want to run `cmake` before `make` to generate the Makefile. The array contains the list of arguments (including the working path directory !).

### Usage Examples

```js
grunt.initConfig({
  submake: {
    target1: {
      projects: {
        // For each of these projects, the specified make rules will be executed:
        'sub-projects/module': '',
        'sub-projects/module2': 'build'
      }
    },
    target2: {
      // Use an array to run multiple rules:
      'sub-projects/module': [ 'clean', 'test' ]
    },
    target3: {
      // you can add parameters by add an array depth
      'sub-projects/module': [ 'clean', [ 'build', '--dist="/usr/bin/"' ]]
    },
    target4: [
      // Using an array will just execute make for each one:
      'sub-projects/module',
      'sub-projects/module2'
    ],
    target5: {
      // you can run cmake (with arguments) before make:
      options: {
        cmake: ['.']
      },
      projects: [
        'sub-projects/module'
      ]
    }
    target6: {
      // no need for subprojects, you can handle interoperability
      // by running make at the project root (or anywhere else)
      '.': 'build'
    },
  },
});
```

## Contributing
In lieu of a formal styleguide, take care to maintain the existing coding style. Add unit tests for any new or changed functionality. Lint and test your code using [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/).

Do not hesitate to open an [issue](https://github.com/pidupuis/grunt-submake/issues) to report a bug. Any <b>ideas of improvement</b> are also welcome as issue!

## Release History

* ~0.2.0: CMake command can now be run with arguments
* ~0.1.0: Run `make` rules  (with arguments or not) for specific paths; Can also run CMake beforehand to generate the Makefile
